# Simple Password Generator

I take my privacy very seriously, just like I think everyone should. So, I decided to make a basic password generator using only HTML5, CSS3, and super basic jQuery. It creates a unique string of characters for you to use. If you need a password manager, I highly recommend 1Password (https://my.1password.com). I've been a subscriber since December 2018 and couldn't see myself without it.
